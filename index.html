<h2>Introduction</h1>
<p>Orginally from Scotland, I trained as a civil engineer and obtained a 1st class honours Master's degree from the University of Warwick in 2016. 
I then moved to the University of Cambridge, where I completed a second Master's degree, this time focusing on interdisplinary engineering research methods. </p>
