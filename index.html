<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Orginally from Scotland, I trained as a civil engineer and obtained a 1st class honours Master's degree from the University of Warwick in 2016. 
I then moved to the University of Cambridge to complete a second Master's degree, this time focusing on interdisplinary engineering research methods. </p>
<br>
<p> I stayed at the Cambridge University Engineering Department to complete my PhD, which evaluated the impact of catchment-scale natural flood management (NFM) on the performance of downstream urban drainage. 
I submitted my thesis in October 2020 - see details of this research (as well as my ongoing research interests) under a seperate tab. </p>
<br>
<p> I then took a position as a 'Research Fellow in Off-Grid Sanitation' at the Cranfield Water Science Institute. I worked on the 'Scaling up Off-grid Sanitation' project
as part of an international research consortium evaluating the ability of Container-based Sanitation (CBS) to serve impoverished urban environments. Please see details of this
  work under a separate tab. </p>
<br>
<p> In September 2021, I moved to the Galapagos Islands with my partner. Since then I have been working on various projects and consultancies relating to sustainable community development (with a focus on improved water access).
