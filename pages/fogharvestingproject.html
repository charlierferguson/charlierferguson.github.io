<h2> Background </h2>

<p> Fog harvesting, not as well-known as rainwater harvesting, has an established technical credibility with case 
studies ranging from South Africa (Olivier, 2004) to Azerbijan (Meunier and Beysens, 2016) to Colombia (Garcia-Ubaque,
Vaca-Bohorquez and Garcia-Ubaque, 2013). However, knowledge on the technology remains fragmented (Qadir et al., 2021).
There remain limited field studies on the quality of water yields (Kaseke and Wang, 2018), as well as the social implications
  of domestic use (Lucier and Qadir, 2018). </p>
<br>

<p> Fog harvesting has been shown to have potential in the Galápagos Islands. For at least five months of the year around
archipelago, the rural highlands see persistent fog and mist (known locally as the ‘garúa’). Limited trials on San
Cristobal island have been reported on by Echeverria et al. (2020), who found standard collectors with 50% shade
coefficient could produce 7.9 l/m2/day at certain times of year. The study only lasted 48 days but recommended further
trials and domestic implantation around the Galápagos. The Charles Darwin Foundation (CDF) have also been running a trial
in the highlands of Isabela (at about 500m elevation) with three nets (each approximately 40m2).  in separate locations
Anecdotally, these nets produce at least 1,000 litres each month (reaching 14,000 in good months). The picture here is of one
  of the CDF nets. </p>

<h2> Project Description </h2>
<p>The purpose of the project is to collect technical and social data to inform a robust evaluation on the feasibility of
fog harvesting contributing to a sustainable water supply strategy for the highlands of Santa Cruz. Eight ‘demonstration’ sites will be
established in Santa Rosa, as evidence suggests Bellavista is too low for effective fog harvesting (Echeverria et al., 2020).
These sites will demonstrate best-practice to the wider community and provide test sites for a year-long monitoring
programme collecting data on the water quantity, the water quality and social implications of the technology. The locations
of the eight demonstration sites will be a mix of domestic and agricultural locations identified through liaison with the local NGO
'Fundacion Un Cambio por la Vida' (FUNCAVID) and the parish council. A uniform net design based on established approaches (i.e. using a 65% shade raschel net)
  will be used in all locations. </p>

<br>

<p>A technical study will monitor both quantity and quality of the water from each site. This will be done using a DelAgua Field test kit and a series 
  of tipping bucket flow gauges. <\p>
